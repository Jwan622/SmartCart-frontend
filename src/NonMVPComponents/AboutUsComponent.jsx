      Mission Statement:<br /><br />

Our mission is to empower individuals and families to save time and money on their grocery shopping. We address the common challenge faced by people seeking savings on grocery bills but lacking the time to compare prices across various supermarkets, including non-traditional stores like Indian, Russian, and Asian markets. Our application streamlines the shopping experience by allowing users to create a cart that calculates and compares total prices across multiple stores within their desired radius.
Our app enables users to select grocery stores, compare total prices, and identifies the store offering the best overall value for their shopping needs.<br /><br />

For example, users can search for individual items like onions and easily find the most affordable option at a specific store. However, when users add multiple items to their cart, such as onions, potatoes, and tomatoes, our app reveals the store that offers the most cost-efficient combination.<br /><br />

Our application caters to individuals seeking both time and cost efficiency. Users benefit from the convenience of obtaining the best prices for their entire shopping list in one place, ultimately saving them time and money.<br /><br />

To develop our application further we will utilize resources such as geolocation, various APIs, and potentially web scraping to gather real-time price data directly from store websites.<br /><br />
